## MessageSource

`MessageSource` is an interface provided by Spring Framework that represents a source of messages for internationalization and localization in an application. It is responsible for resolving messages based on a message key and the current locale.

In the context of Spring Boot, the `MessageSource` is typically used in conjunction with properties files that contain the translated messages for different locales. The `MessageSource` implementation in Spring Boot, `ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource`, loads these message files and provides methods to retrieve the appropriate message based on the current locale.

The `getMessage` method takes the message key ("greeting"), optional message arguments (null in this case), and the Locale. It resolves the appropriate message based on the key and locale, returning the localized message.

## Configuration Properties

The provided configuration properties pertain to message localization and handling locale resolution in a Spring Boot application. Let's explain each property:

- `spring.messages.basename=messages`: This property specifies the base name for the message resource files. By default, Spring Boot looks for message files with the base name "messages" (e.g., messages.properties, messages_en.properties, etc.). This property tells Spring Boot to use "messages" as the base name. These message files contain translations of messages in different locales.

- `spring.messages.encoding=UTF-8`: This property sets the encoding for the message resource files. It ensures that the message files are read and interpreted correctly using the UTF-8 character encoding. UTF-8 is a widely used encoding that supports a broad range of characters, including international characters used in different languages.

- `spring.mvc.locale=ACCEPT_HEADER`: This property configures the locale resolution strategy for the Spring MVC framework. Setting it to ACCEPT_HEADER means that Spring MVC will determine the current locale based on the Accept-Language header of the incoming HTTP request. The Accept-Language header contains the preferred languages specified by the client. By using this strategy, Spring MVC will automatically resolve the locale based on the client's preferred languages, making the application more user-friendly for international users.

## Set the Locale

You need to set the appropriate locale for each request. You can do this in several ways:

- Using a `LocaleResolver`: Configure a `LocaleResolver` bean to determine the current locale based on the request. Spring Boot provides a `SessionLocaleResolver`, `CookieLocaleResolver`, and `AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver`. Choose the one that suits your requirements and configure it as a bean.

- Using a parameter in the request URL: You can include a locale parameter in the request URL to specify the desired locale. For example, `/greeting?lang=fr`.

- Using the Accept-Language header: The browser sends an Accept-Language header with the requested locales. You can configure Spring Boot to use this header to determine the locale by setting `spring.mvc.locale` property in `application.properties` to `ACCEPT_HEADER`.
